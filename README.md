# Liver-Disease-Prediction
Liver Disease Prediction using Ensemble based Approach

The Project is directed towards comparing the performance of various Machine Learning Algorithms namely Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine in the prediction of liver disease based on a set of patient parameter

SOFTWARE USED â€“ ANACONDA SPYDER
INSTRUCTIONS TO EXECUTE THE CODE:
1. Open the Anaconda command prompt. To do this type cmd in the
Start Menu.
2. Change the directory to the location where the folder containing
the code is saved. To do this type the following command:
cd <file location>
where <file location> is the location of the file where the code is
saved.
3. After changing the directory, type the following command :
python main.py
This will launch the GUI.
4. In the GUI select the Browse button and upload the dataset on
which the algorithms have to be performed. If proper dataset is not
selected an error message is shown.
5. After loading the dataset click on each of the buttons namely
Preprocess, Random forest, Decision Tree and SVM to perform
each of these operations on the dataset.
6. Upon clicking on the relevant button, the graphs relevant to each of
these operations are displayed and the results as well as all the
plots are automatically saved in the Result folder to be viewed later
on.
7. To quit from the application press the Quit button.
